Understanding the Gantt Chart
This Gantt chart is a visual representation of the optimized task schedule that was generated by the genetic algorithm. Hereâ€™s what the chart conveys:

1. Tasks (Y-Axis)
Each horizontal bar represents a task from your project (e.g., T1, T2, ..., T9).
The tasks are listed vertically along the y-axis. For example:
T1: Site Preparation
T2: Foundation Laying
T3: Steel Frame Erection
And so on.
2. Time (X-Axis)
The x-axis shows the timeline in hours. This is the time frame in which the tasks are scheduled.
The position of each bar on the x-axis represents the start time and end time of that task. The length of each bar represents the duration of the task.
For example:
T1 starts at approximately hour 0 and ends at hour 40, indicating a duration of 40 hours.
T3 starts at around hour 40 and ends at hour 140, indicating a duration of 100 hours.
3. Color Coding (Workers/Machines)
Each color represents a different worker or machine that is responsible for performing the task. The color legend on the bottom right of the chart indicates which worker or machine corresponds to each color.
For example, M1 (cyan) represents the Excavator, W1 (blue) represents the Electrician, and so on.
You can see that tasks assigned to the same worker/machine are color-coded the same way. For example:
T1 and T3 are both assigned to machines (cyan for M1, yellow for M3).
Workers like W4 (red) and W3 (orange) are assigned specific tasks like Roofing Installation and Interior Walls.
4. Task Duration and Start Times
The number in the middle of each bar indicates the duration of the task in hours (e.g., 40h, 100h, 60h).
The position of the bar along the x-axis tells you when the task starts and finishes. For example:
T1 starts at hour 0 and finishes at hour 40.
T9 starts at around hour 120 and finishes at hour 140.
5. Optimized Schedule
The genetic algorithm optimizes the schedule to minimize idle time for workers and machines while respecting task dependencies and other constraints.
In this chart, you can see that some tasks are staggered (e.g., T2 and T3 overlap slightly), while others have gaps between them (e.g., T4 starts after T3 finishes).
What This Achieves
The Gantt chart provides a clear visual representation of how the tasks are scheduled over time, which workers/machines are assigned to which tasks, and how the schedule has been optimized. You can use this chart to understand:

When each task starts and finishes.
Which workers or machines are involved in each task.
Whether there are any idle periods or overlaps.
How the overall project progresses over time.
This visualization is especially useful for project managers, as it allows them to assess the efficiency of the task schedule and make adjustments if necessary.
